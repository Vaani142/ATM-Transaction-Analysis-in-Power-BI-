# ATM-Transaction-Analysis-Project-in-POWER-BI 
This project is about building an interactive dashboard to understand, analyse and gain insights from the transactional data of ATMs of bank situated at different locations. The insights so obtained will help to improve bank's service delivery to the customer and also help to identify areas of scope for improvement
The dataset can be accessed through link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11h6RCsniJXMrfRhXnxSo_8-buBveWcgU

It consists of data related to transactions(of 5 states in Africa), customers, ATM location, calender, transaction type, hour data. All the these data were loaded to the PowerBI and few new columns were calculated folowing which the models were loaded and visuals were created. The visuals so created will garner to the bank managements queries raised and also help them to perform better decisions based on the data.

Some of the key insights and recommendations are as below
Key Insights:
1.	Utilization rate of ATMs is the highest in Kano (18.55%) and lowest in Federal Capital territory (8.46%) 
2.	Withdrawal (56%) and Transfer (22%) constitute the major proportion of ATM transactions 
3.	March 2022 witnessed the highest volume of transaction and the transaction amount peaked during this month. This might be due any special occasion, festival, holiday, or any other public event where this is chance of spike in spending
4.	The transaction count plotted against the hour axis show an uptick in transaction count from 6.00am onwards which rises and remains almost the same until 2pm. Following 2 o clock there is sudden surge in the transaction which sustains until 6.00pm and further that the count tanks down
5.	Some trend is observed in the pattern of transaction count vs month over the period of entire year. Starting from January the count starts on higher value and tanks in February, again the count increase in March and tanks in April. This might be since some customers are preferring to withdraw money considering to used for the period of 45-60 days
6.	Withdrawal transaction type are predominant in all age groups and age groups – 26-35 are the highest contributors to this, followed by 36-45 and 16-25. Similarly, pattern is observed in case of transfer transaction type. 
7.	26-35 age group customer’s withdraw, transfer, deposit transaction types account for 642K transactions worth 13 billion (roughly 33% of total transactional value)
8.	Lagos has the highest number of transactions and Federal Capital Territory has the lowest 
9.	In all types of transactions students account for the majority 
10.	Most common withdrawal transactions amounts are - 10000, 20000, and 50000

Recommendations:
1.	A spike in observed in the transactional volume every alternate month starting from January hence this information can be used to refill the cash reserves in the ATM machines so that it does not run out of cash which will thereby improve customer satisfaction and service delivery
2.	Utilization rate of Kano being the highest, followed by Lagos which also has high transactional volume bank management can plan of increasing ATM outlets in these regions
3.	Maintenance activities and cash refilling of ATMs should be preferably conducted during the non-peak hours. It is observed for all regions the transactional volume is highest during 02.00pm – 06.00pm, hence this time period of the day must be avoided by service technicians to streamline the ATM service delivery to customers.
